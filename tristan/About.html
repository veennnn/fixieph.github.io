  <h1 class="story">Story of Ghost Speed</h1>

  <h1 name="About" class="story2">We only deal in the best, most pristine, well specified stock, as experience has taught us that these calibres of cars sell themselves. For this reason, we do not employ sales staff in the traditional sense of the word, although we do ensure all our staff have extensive product knowledge of the cars and realise that at this level, the customer service experience needs to be absolutely first class. We are a predominantly family run business with a high level of lengthy staff retention and this has enabled us to build long term relationships with clients, ensuring we develop a strong understanding of how to meet or exceed their expectations.</h1>
  <h1 class="story2">The rarity and exclusivity of the type of cars we deal in, obviously attracts a global audience and although we always hope to meet our clients in person, we have routinely sent cars to customers "sight unseen" all over the world. The trust our clients place in us, has led to a significant proportion of our business deriving from customer referrals and we continually strive to make a Supercar buying experience from Amari Supercars something special, befitting the quality of cars we have on offer. Our most established customer has been with us for 29 years and we have sold him 86 cars to date - hopefully an endorsement of our approach!</h1>
